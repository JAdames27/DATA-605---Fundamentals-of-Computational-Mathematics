# Problem 1

## 1.1 (Bayesian)

A new credit scoring system has been developed to predict the likelihood of loan defaults. The system has a 90% sensitivity, meaning that it correctly identifies 90% of those who will default on their loans. It also has a 95% specificity, meaning that it correctly identifies 95% of those who will not default. The default rate among borrowers is 2%. 

\textbf{Bayes' Theorem: $P(A|B)=\frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}$ }

### (a) Given these prevalence, sensitivity, and specificity estimates, what is the probability that a borrower flagged by the system as likely to default will actually default?

```{r }

sens <- 0.90 
spec <- 0.95    
prev <- 0.02 
avg_loss <- 200000 #per default
test_cost <- 500   #per borrower
n <- 10000         #number of borrowers

prob_flag_def <- (sens * prev) / (sens * prev + (1 - spec) * (1 - prev))

cat("The probability that a borrower flagged by the 
system as likely to default will actually default is:", 
    round(prob_flag_def, 4) * 100, "%\n")

```

## 1.1 (Bayesian)

### (b) If the average loss per defaulted loan is \$200,000 and the cost to run the credit scoring test on each borrower is \$500, what is the total first-year cost for evaluating 10,000 borrowers?

```{r }

#Calculating total costs for evaluating 10,000 borrowers
n_flag_pos <- prob_flag_def * n * prev
tot_loss <- n_flag_pos * avg_loss #from defaults
tot_test_cost <- n * test_cost
tot_cost <- tot_loss + tot_test_cost

## 2.9 (Expected Value of a Business Deal)

A company is evaluating a deal where they either gain $4 for every successful contract or lose $16 for every unsuccessful contract. A "successful" contract is defined as drawing a queen or lower from a standard deck of cards. (Aces are considered the highest card in the deck.)

### (a) Step 1: Find the expected value of the deal. Round your answer to two decimal places. Losses must be expressed as negative values.

```{r }

# Given probabilities
p_success <- 48 / 52   # Probability of drawing a queen or lower
p_failure <- 4 / 52    # Probability of drawing an ace

# Gains and losses
gain_success <- 4      # Gain per successful contract
loss_failure <- -16    # Loss per unsuccessful contract

# Step 1: Expected value of the deal
expected_value <- (gain_success * p_success) + (loss_failure * p_failure)

# Display results rounded to two decimal places
cat("Step 1: Expected value of the deal:", round(expected_value, 2), "\n")

```

## 2.9 (Expected Value of a Business Deal)

# Problem 3

## 3.1 (Supply Chain Risk Assessment)

Let $X_1, X_2, ..., X_n$ represent the lead times (in days) for the delivery of key components from $n=5$ different suppliers. Each lead time is uniformly distributed across a range of 1 to $k=20$ days, reflecting the uncertainty in delivery times. Let $Y$ denote the minimum delivery time among all suppliers. Understanding the distribution of $Y$ is crucial for assessing the earliest possible time you can begin production. Determine the distribution of $Y$ to better manage your supply chain and minimize downtime.

```{r }

# Parameters
n <- 5        # Number of suppliers
k <- 20       # Maximum lead time in days
num_sim <- 10000  # Number of simulations

# Simulate the distribution of Y
set.seed(123)  # For reproducibility
min_lead_times <- replicate(num_sim, min(runif(n, 1, k)))

# Plot the distribution of Y
hist(min_lead_times, breaks = 30, 
     main = "Distribution of Minimum Lead Time (Y)",
     xlab = "Minimum Lead Time (Days)", ylab = "Frequency",
     col = "lightblue", border = "black")

```

## 3.2 (Maintenance Planning for Critical Equipment)

Your organization owns a critical piece of equipment, such as a high-capacity photocopier (for a law firm) or an MRI machine (for a healthcare provider). The manufacturer estimates the expected lifetime of this equipment to be 8 years, meaning that, on average, you expect one failure every 8 years. It's essential to understand the likelihood of failure over time to plan for maintenance and replacements.

### (a) Geometric Model:

Calculate the probability that the machine will not fail for the first 6 years. Also, provide the expected value and standard deviation. This model assumes each year the machine either fails or does not, independently of previous years.

```{r }

# Parameters
p <- 1 / 8          # Probability of failure each year

# Problem 4

## 4.1  Scenario: You are managing two independent servers in a data center. The time until the next failure for each server follows an exponential distribution with different rates:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Server A has a failure rate of $\lambda_A = 0.5$ failures per hour
  \item Server B has a failure rate of $\lambda_B = 0.3$ failures per hour 
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Question:} What is the distribution of the total time until both servers have failed at least once? Use the moment generating function (MGF) to find the distribution of the sum of the times to failure.

```{r }

# Parameters

lambda_B <- 0.3  # Failure rate for Server B
n_sim <- 10000   # Number of simulations for approximation

# Step 1: Simulate the total time to failure for both servers
set.seed(123)  # For reproducibility
total_times <- rexp(n_sim, rate = lambda_A) + rexp(n_sim, rate = lambda_B)

# Step 2: Plot the distribution of the simulated total times
hist(total_times, breaks = 50, probability = TRUE,
     main = "Distribution of Total Time Until Both Servers Fail",
     xlab = "Total Time (Hours)", col = "lightblue", border = "black")

# Step 3: Calculate the theoretical expected value and standard deviation
expected_value <- 1 / lambda_A + 1 / lambda_B

## 4.2 Sum of Independent Normally Distributed Random Variables

\textbf{Scenario: An investment firm is analyzing the returns of two independent assets, Asset X and Asset Y. The returns on these assets are normally distributed:}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Asset X: $X ~ N(\mu_X = 5\%, \sigma^2_X = 4\%)$
  \item Asset Y: $Y ~ N(\mu_Y = 7\%, \sigma^2_Y = 9\%)$
\end{itemize}

  \item Region B: $X_B \sim Poisson(\lambda_B = 5)$
\end{itemize}

# Problem 5

## 5.1 Customer Retention and Churn Analysis

\textbf{Scenario: A telecommunications company wants to model the behavior of its customers regarding their likelihood to stay with the company (retention) or leave for a competitor (churn). The company segments its customers into three states:}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{State 1:} Active customers who are satisfied and likely to stay (Retention state).
  \item \textbf{State 2:} Customers who are considering leaving (At-risk state).
  \item \textbf{State 3:} Customers who have left (Churn state).
\end{itemize}

The company has historical data showing the following monthly transition probabilities:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{From State 1 (Retention):} 80% stay in State 1, 15% move to State 2, and 5% move to State 3.
  \item \textbf{From State 2 (At-risk):} 30% return to State 1, 50% stay in State 2, and 20% move to State 3.
  \item \textbf{From State 3 (Churn):} 100% stay in State 3.
\end{itemize}

The company wants to analyze the long-term behavior of its customer base.

\textbf{Question:} (a) Construct the transition matrix for this Markov Chain.

```{r }

# Step (a): Define the transition matrix
transition_matrix <- matrix(c(
  0.80, 0.15, 0.05,  # From State 1
  0.30, 0.50, 0.20,  # From State 2
  0.00, 0.00, 1.00   # From State 3
), nrow = 3, byrow = TRUE)

# Display the transition matrix
transition_matrix

```

## 5.1 Customer Retention and Churn Analysis

\textbf{Question:} (b) If a customer starts as satisfied (State 1), what is the probability that they will eventually churn (move to State 3)?

```{r }

# Step (b): Calculate the probability of eventually 
# churning (absorbing probabilities)
# This requires creating a sub-matrix of transient 
# states and calculating the fundamental matrix
Q <- transition_matrix[1:2, 1:2]
R <- transition_matrix[1:2, 3]

# Fundamental matrix: N = (I - Q)^-1
I <- diag(2)
N <- solve(I - Q)

# Probability of reaching State 3 (churn) from each starting transient state
absorption_prob <- N %*% R

# Probability of eventually churning from State 1
prob_churn_from_state_1 <- absorption_prob[1, 1]

```

## 5.1 Customer Retention and Churn Analysis

\textbf{Question:} (c) Determine the steady-state distribution of this Markov Chain. What percentage of customers can the company expect to be in each state in the long run?

```{r }

# Step (c): Steady-state distribution
# Solve for the steady-state vector such that pi * P = pi
eigen_results <- eigen(t(transition_matrix))
steady_state <- eigen_results$vectors[, 1]
steady_state <- steady_state / sum(steady_state)  # Normalize to sum to 1

# Output results
list(
  transition_matrix = transition_matrix,
  prob_churn_from_state_1 = prob_churn_from_state_1,
  steady_state_distribution = steady_state
)

```

## 5.2: Inventory Management in a Warehouse

\textbf{Scenario: A warehouse tracks the inventory levels of a particular product using a Markov Chain model. The inventory levels are categorized into three states:}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{State 1:} High inventory (More than 100 units in stock).
  \item \textbf{State 2:} Medium inventory (Between 50 and 100 units in stock).
  \item \textbf{State 3:} Low inventory (Less than 50 units in stock).
\end{itemize}

The warehouse has the following transition probabilities for inventory levels from one month to the next:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{From State 1 (High):} 70% stay in State 1, 25% move to State 2, and 5% move to State 3.
  \item \textbf{From State 2 (Medium):} 20% move to State 1, 50% stay in State 2, and 30% move to State 3.
  \item \textbf{From State 3 (Low):} 10% move to State 1, 40% move to State 2, and 50% stay in State 3.
\end{itemize}

The warehouse management wants to optimize its restocking strategy by understanding the long-term distribution of inventory levels.

\textbf{Question:} (a) Construct the transition matrix for this Markov Chain. 

```{r }

# Step (a): Define the transition matrix
transition_matrix <- matrix(c(
  0.70, 0.25, 0.05,  # From State 1
  0.20, 0.50, 0.30,  # From State 2
  0.10, 0.40, 0.50   # From State 3
), nrow = 3, byrow = TRUE)

# Display the transition matrix
transition_matrix

```

## 5.2: Inventory Management in a Warehouse

\textbf{Question:} (b) If the warehouse starts with a high inventory level (State 1), what is the probability that it will eventually end up in a low inventory level (State 3)? 

```{r }

# Step (b): Calculate the probability of eventually ending up in State 3
# We calculate this by raising the matrix to a high power
n_steps <- 100  # Number of steps to approximate steady state
transition_matrix_power <- transition_matrix ^ n_steps

# Probability of ending up in State 3 from each starting state
prob_eventual_low_inventory_from_state_1 <- transition_matrix_power[1, 3]

```

## 5.2: Inventory Management in a Warehouse

\textbf{Question:} (c) Determine the steady-state distribution of this Markov Chain. What is the long-term expected proportion of time that the warehouse will spend in each inventory state?

```{r }

# Step (c): Steady-state distribution
# Solve for the steady-state vector such that pi * P = pi
eigen_results <- eigen(t(transition_matrix))
steady_state <- eigen_results$vectors[, 1]
steady_state <- steady_state / sum(steady_state)  # Normalize to sum to 1

# Output results
list(
  transition_matrix = transition_matrix,
  prob_eventual_low_inventory_from_state_1 = prob_eventual_low_inventory_from_state_1,
